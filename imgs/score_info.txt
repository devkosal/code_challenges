Task Score / Total score is calculated based on how the program performs on our test data. A score less than 100 means that we have found some problems.

Correctness describes how much the solution adheres to the specification. Points for correctness are deducted if the program produces invalid results or crashes.

Performance describes if the program behaves correctly for large inputs. Points are deducted if the program exceeds the time limit on large data sets, which indicates a sub-optimal approach.
